We define the intraclass correlation coefficient ({ICC}) and the design effect, and we explain their effect on the standard error. When the {ICC} is greater than 0, then the design effect is greater than 1. In such a scenario, the standard error produced under the assumption of independence is underestimated. This increases the Type I error rate. We provide a short illustration of the effect of non-independence on the standard error.We show that after accounting for the design effect, our decision about the statistical significance of the test statistic changes.When we fail to account for the clustered nature of the data, we conclude that the difference between the two groups is statistically significant. However, once we adjust the standard error for the design effect, the difference is no longer statistically significant.},

	abstract = {This study extends the traditional Actor-Partner Interdependence model ({APIM}; Kenny, 1996) to incorporate dyadic data with multiple indicators reﬂecting latent constructs. Although the {APIM} has been widely used to model interdependence in dyads, the method and its applications have largely been limited to single sets of manifest variables. This article presents three extensions of the {APIM} that can be applied to multivariate dyadic data; a manifest {APIM} linking multiple indicators as manifest variables, a composite-score {APIM} relating univariate sums of multiple variables, and a latent {APIM} connecting underlying constructs of multiple indicators. The properties of the three methods in analyzing data with various dyadic patterns are investigated through a simulation study. It is found that the latent {APIM} adequately estimates dyadic relationships and holds reasonable power when measurement reliability is not too low, whereas the manifest {APIM} yields poor power and high type I error rates in general. The composite-score {APIM}, even though it is found to be a better alternative to the manifest {APIM}, fails to correctly reﬂect latent dyadic interdependence, raising inferential concerns. We illustrate the {APIM} extensions for multivariate dyadic data analysis by an example study on relationship commitment and happiness among married couples in Wisconsin. In cases where the measures are reliable reﬂections of psychological constructs, we suggest using the latent {APIM} for examining research hypotheses that discuss implications beyond observed variables. We conclude with stressing the importance of carefully examining measurement models when designing and conducting dyadic data analyses.},

(b) Extensive measurement error diminishes power and can prevent invalid models from being rejected. (c) Even a little measurement error can cause valid models to appear invalid. (d) Differential measurement error in various parts of a model can change the substantive conclusions that derive from path analysis. (e) All of these problems become increasingly serious and intractable as models become more complex. Methods to prevent and correct these problems are reviewed.

However, claims of sameness and/or difference between groups rely on two critical, yet widely under-appreciated assumptions: that the concepts being compared between groups are the same (i.e., measurement invariance), and that logically and statistically coherent procedures are used for evaluating sameness (i.e., equivalence testing). We evaluated the state of measurement invariance and equivalence across three studies, involving different types of {CNM} comparisons (i.e., relationship types, partner types) and designs (analysis of primary individual data, primary dyadic data, and secondary data). Our invariance tests of {CNM} compared to monogamous individuals (Study 1) and “primary” compared to “secondary” partners in dyadic appraisal of {CNM} individuals (Study 2) revealed that many measures of well-being failed to replicate their measurement models and were not generalizable across relationship types or partner types. Our reanalyses of existing comparative {CNM} effects using individual and meta-analyzed equivalence tests (Study 3), meanwhile, indicated that this literature requires more consistent reporting practices and larger samples, as most studies produced uninformative tests of equivalence. Our results illustrate the importance of auxiliary hypothesis evaluation and statistical procedure selection for generating informative comparative tests. Our findings also highlight potential divergences in social construction of well-being. We offer suggestions for researchers, reviewers, and editors in terms of needed methodological reforms for future comparative {CNM} research.},

In this research, we evaluate relationship science, a major subﬁeld of social–personality psychology, illustrating both the unique diversity-relevant challenges faced by particular subﬁelds and the barriers to inclusive and diverse research that are shared across research areas. Speciﬁcally, we examine the sample diversity and reporting practices of 1,762 studies published in eight mainstream psychology and relationships journals at two time points—(a) 1996–2000 and (b) 2016–2020—and center our analysis around ﬁve focal sample characteristics: gender, sexual orientation, regional context, socioeconomic status ({SES}), and race. We ﬁnd that reporting practices and representation have not improved for some core demographic characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status) and that even in domains for which reporting practices have improved (e.g., sexual orientation), reporting remains limited. Further, we ﬁnd that reporting practices in relationship science frequently center Whiteness (e.g., “participants were mostly White”), obscure or overlook potential sexual orientation diversity (e.g., implying that individuals in man–woman dyads are “heterosexual”), and treat the United States as the contextual default (e.g., participants came from a “large Southeastern university”).

This article presents the freely available {semPlot} package for R, which ﬁlls the gap between advanced, but time-consuming, graphical software and the limited graphics produced automatically by {SEM} software. In addition, {semPlot} offers more functionality than drawing path diagrams: It can act as a common ground for importing {SEM} results into R. Any result usable as input to {semPlot} can also be represented in any of the 3 popular {SEM} frameworks, as well as translated to input syntax for the R packages sem (Fox, Nie, \& Byrnes, 2013) and lavaan (Rosseel, 2012). Special considerations are made in the package for the automatic placement of variables, using 3 novel algorithms that extend the earlier work of Boker, {McArdle}, and Neale (2002). The article concludes with detailed instructions on these node-placement algorithms.},

	abstract = {The discipline of psychology is undergoing a credibility revolution whereby researchers are critically evaluating and improving their research practices. In this review, we consider how the field of relationship science could capitalize on this movement in the context of four types of validity. Regarding statistical‐conclusions validity, we find that relationship scientists are engaging in open science practices (e.g., preregistration, open data sharing) at similar rates to other fields in the context of personality and social psychology journals. However, journals that are specific to the field (i.e., close relationships journals) could do more to encourage these practices. Meanwhile, new meta‐scientific research suggests that the field would benefit greatly from rigorous, widescale measurement validation work (construct validity), novel strategies to account for causal confounds (internal validity), and more diverse representation in our samples and measures (external validity). Overall, the credibility revolution offers several specific, actionable recommendations to improve the validity of research findings, many of which are highly relevant to relationship science.},

Specific situations present specific problems and opportunities, logically implying the relevance of specific motives and permitting their expression. Via the concept of transformation, the theory explains how interaction is shaped by broader considerations such as long-term goals and concern for a partner's welfare. The theory illuminates our understanding of social-cognitive processes that are of longstanding interest to psychologists such as cognition and affect, attribution, and self-presentation. The theory also explains adaptation to repeatedly encountered interdependence patterns, as well as the embodiment of such adaptations in interpersonal dispositions, relationship-specific motives, and social norms.},

	abstract = {When one gathers dyadic data, one is very often faced with the burdensome task of restructuring the data. For instance, the use of multiple regression analysis or structural equation modeling ({SEM}) requires one type of data structure, whereas multilevel modeling or multilevel {SEM} usually requires a different data structure. However, data are often entered in neither of these structures. In this article, we first describe the most typical dyadic data formats, what format the major data-analytic methods require, and then present a toolbox called restructure and describe dyadic data ({RDDD}) with programs that restructure dyadic data from one format into another. Moreover, the programs identify different types of dyadic variables and provide descriptive and inferential statistics that can be informative to dyadic researchers. The programs, written in R, provide a graphical user interface and are designed to work with minimal input information that is much less than standard restructuring procedures.},

	abstract = {Attachment insecurity is characterized by chronic concerns about whether partners can fulﬁl core relatedness needs, including feeling loved and cared about. In two longitudinal studies, our aim was to extend current evidence that certain relationship conditions buffer attachment insecurity by (1) focusing on the central ingredient—fulﬁlment of relatedness needs—that likely account for buffering effects, and (2) illustrate the importance of general experiences of relatedness need fulﬁlment across couples’ lives. Couple members completed initial assessments of attachment insecurity, reported on the fulﬁlment of relatedness needs every month for 6 months (Study 1) or daily for 3 weeks (Study 2), and then completed re-assessments of attachment insecurity 6-months (Study 1) or 9-months (Study 2) later. Across both studies, greater fulﬁlment of relatedness needs across monthly and daily relationship life predicted decreases in attachment anxiety and avoidance. General experiences of relatedness across couples’ lives appear to reﬂect a relationship environment that fulﬁls core needs for love, care, and regard that cultivate attachment security.},
