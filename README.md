The goal of dySEM is help automate the process of using lavaan() to fit
latent dyadic data analysis models. Currently the package supports the
fitting of dyadic measurement invariance models (including assessing
magnitude of dyadic noninvariance), and latent Actor-Partner
Interdependence Models (APIMs). Once fitted, automated output includes
tables and/or path diagrams.
