Description: Scripting of structural equation models via `lavaan` for
    Dyadic Data Analysis, and helper functions for supplemental
    calculations, tabling, and model visualization.  Current models
    supported include: Dyadic CFA, APIM (observed and latent), CFM
    (observed and latent), MIM (latent), and the BiDy Model (latent).
