# Ratings on the full Investment Model Scale (IMS) from 282 (M)ixed-sex couples

A data set containing 5 ratings for each of (1) satisfaction, (2)
quality of alternatives, (3) investment, and 4 (commitment) for each
member of a mixed-sex romantic dyad. Measured using the Investment Model
Scale subscales (Rusbult, Martz, & Agnew, 1998). Data are from Sakaluk,
Fisher, and Kilshaw's (2021) study of dyadic invariance. Variable names
have been re-coded to follow a stem-item-partner ("sip") order, with a
delimiter ("\_") between the item number and partner distinguishing
character.
