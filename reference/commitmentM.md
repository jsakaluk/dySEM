# Ratings of relational satisfaction and commitment from 282 (M)ixed-sex couples

A data set containing 5 ratings of satisfaction and 5 ratings of
commitment for each member of a mixed-sex romantic dyad. Measured using
the Investment Model Scale subscales (Rusbult, Martz, & Agnew, 1998).
Data are from Sakaluk, Fisher, and Kilshaw's (2021) study of dyadic
invariance. Variable names have been re-coded to follow a
stem-item-partner ("sip") order, with a delimiter ("\_") between the
item number and partner distinguishing character.
