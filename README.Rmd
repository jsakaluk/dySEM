## Summary

The `dySEM` helps automate the process of scripting, fitting, and reporting on latent models of dyadic data via [`lavaan`](http://lavaan.ugent.be). The package was developed and used in the course of the research described in [Sakaluk, Fisher, & Kilshaw](https://psyarxiv.com/9vcnz/) (in press). We are targeting the first stable release for ~end of March 2021, and hope to submit the package to CRAN sometime in the summer. 

The `dySEM` logo was designed by Wolfgang Deranleau (for logo design inquiries, email: agangofwolves@gmail.com).

## Current Functionality 

The package currently provides functionality regarding the following types of latent dyadic data models: 

1. **Dyadic Confirmatory Factor Analysis** 
1. **Latent Actor-Partner Interdependence Models (APIM)**
1. **I-SAT Models**
1. **I-NULL Models**
1. **Latent Common Fate Models (CFM)**
1. **Latent Bifactor Dyadic (Bi-Dy) Models**
1. **Observed Actor-Partner Interdependence (APIM)**
  
Additional features currently include:

* Automated specification of invariance constraints for any model, including full indistinguishability
* Functions to assist with reproducible creation of path diagrams and tables of statistical output
* Functions to calculate supplemental statistical information (e.g., omega reliability, noninvariance effect sizes, corrected model fit indexes)

## Future Functionality
  
Functionality targeted for future development of `dySEM` is tracked [here](https://github.com/jsakaluk/dySEM/projects/1). Current high-priority items include: 

1. Longitudinal dyadic model scripting functions (e.g., curve of factors, common fate growth)
1. Latent dyadic response surface analysis scripting and visualization functions
1. Multi-group dyadic model scripting (e.g., comparing models from samples of heterosexual vs. LGBTQ+ dyads) 
1. Simulation functions to aid in sample size planning (in progress)
1. Unit test creation (in progress)

## Collaboration

Please submit any feature requests via the `dySEM` [issues](https://github.com/jsakaluk/dySEM/issues) page, using the "Wishlist for dySEM Package Development" tag. 

If you are interested in collaborating on the development of `dySEM`, please contact Dr. Sakaluk.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jsakaluk/dySEM")
```
## dySEM Workflow

A `dySEM` workflow typically involves five steps, which are covered in-depth in the [Overview vignette](https://jsakaluk.github.io/dySEM/articles/dySEM.html). Briefly, these steps include:

1. Import and wrangle **data**
1. **Scrape** variables from your data frame
1. **Script** your preferred model
1. **Fit** and **Inspect** your model via `lavaan`
1. **Output** statistical visualizations and/or tables 

There are additional optional functions, as well, that help users to calculate certain additional quantitative values (e.g., reliability, corrected model fit indexes in models with indistinguishable dyad members). 

```{r packagesdata, echo = F, message = F}
library(dySEM)
library(tidyverse)
library(lavaan)
DRES <- as_tibble(select(DRES, PRQC_1.1:PRQC_9.2))
```

### 1. Import and wrangle **data**

Structural equation modeling (SEM) programs like `lavaan` require dyadic data to be in dyad structure data set, whereby each row contains the data for one dyad, with separate columns for each observation made for each member of the dyad. For example: 

```{r DRES}
DRES
```

### 2. **Scrape** variables from your data frame 

The `dySEM` scrapers consider appropriately repetitously named indicators as consisting of at least three distinct elements: stem, item, and partner. **Delimiter** characters (e.g., “.”, "_") are commonly–but not always–used to separate some/all of these elements.`dySEM` scrapers largely function by asking you to specify in what order the elements of variable names are ordered.

```{r scrape}
dvn <- scrapeVarCross(DRES, x_order = "sip", x_stem = "PRQC", x_delim1="_",x_delim2=".",  distinguish_1="1", distinguish_2="2")
```

### 3. **Script** your preferred model

*Scripter* functions like [`scriptCFA`](https://github.com/jsakaluk/dySEM/blob/master/R/scriptCFA.R) typically require only three arguments to be specified: 

1. the `dvn` object (e.g., from `scrapeVarCross`) to be used to script the model
1.arbitrary name(s) for the latent variable(s) you are modeling 
1. the kind of parameter equality constraints that you wish to be imposed (if any)

```{r configscript}
qual.config.script <- scriptCFA(dvn, lvname = "Quality", model = "configural")
```

This function returns a character object with `lavaan` compliant syntax for your chosen model, as well as exporting a reproducible .txt of the scripted model to a /scripts folder in your working directory.

### 4. **Fit** and **Inspect** your model via `lavaan`

You can immediately pass any script(s) returned from a `dySEM` scripter to your preferred `lavaan` wrapper, with your estimator and missing data treatment of choice. For example:

```{r modelfit, warning= FALSE}
qual.config.fit <- lavaan::cfa(qual.config.script, data = DRES, std.lv = FALSE, auto.fix.first= FALSE, meanstructure = TRUE)
```

At this point, the full arsenal of `lavaan` model-inspecting tools are at your disposal. For example: 

```{r summary, eval = FALSE}
summary(qual.config.fit, fit.measures = TRUE, standardized = TRUE, rsquare = TRUE)
```

### 5. **Output** statistical visualizations and/or tables 

`dySEM` also contains functionality to help you quickly, correctly, and reproducibly generate output from your fitted model(s), in the forms of path diagrams and/or tables of statistical values. 

```{r outputModel, eval = FALSE}
outputModel(dvn, model = "cfa", fit = qual.config.fit, 
            table = TRUE, tabletype = "measurement", 
            figure = TRUE, figtype = "unstandardized")
```
