\title{A Function That Writes, Saves, and Exports Syntax for
Fitting Latent Common Fate Models (CFMs)}
\usage{
scriptCFM(
  dvn,
  scaleset = "FF",
  lvxname,
  lvyname,
  constr_dy_x_meas = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"),
  constr_dy_x_struct = c("variances", "means"),
  constr_dy_y_meas = c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dvn}{input dvn list from scrapeVarCross}

\item{scaleset}{Input character to specify how to set the scale of the latent
variable(s). Default is \code{"FF"} (fixed-factor; see Details for rationale),
but user can specify \code{"MV"} (Marker Variable).}

\item{lvxname}{input character to (arbitrarily) name LV X in lavaan syntax}

\item{lvyname}{input character to (arbitrarily) name LV Y in lavaan syntax}

\item{constr_dy_x_meas}{input character vector detailing which measurement model parameters to constrain across dyad members for latent X.
Default is c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"),
but user can specify any combination of "loadings", "intercepts", and "residuals",
or "none" to specify an otherwise unconstrained dyadic configural invariance model}

\item{constr_dy_x_struct}{input character vector detailing which structural model parameters to constrain across dyad members for latent X.
Default is c("variances", "means"),
but user can specify any combination of "variances" and "means", or "none".}

\item{constr_dy_y_meas}{input character vector detailing which measurement model parameters to constrain across dyad members for latent X.
Default is c("loadings", "intercepts", "residuals"),
but user can specify any combination of "loadings", "intercepts", and "residuals",
or "none" to specify an otherwise unconstrained dyadic configural invariance model}

\item{constr_dy_y_struct}{input character vector detailing which structural model parameters to constrain across dyad members for latent X.
Default is c("variances", "means"),
but user can specify any combination of "variances" and "means", or "none".}

\item{constr_dy_xy_struct}{input character vector detailing which structural model parameters to constrain for modeling the predictive association(s) between
partners' latent x and y. Defaults to "none". Options include "p1_zero" or "p2_zero" (to constrain within-person  latent residual covariances between X and Y to zero), or
"covar_zero" (to constrain both within-person latent residual correlations to zero), and/or "dyadic_zero" (to constrain the dyadic effect to zero).}

\item{model}{Deprecated input character used to specify which level of invariance is
modeled. Users should rely upon constr_dy_x_meas/constr_dy_y_meas and
constr_dy_x_struct/constr_dy_y_struct instead, for making constraints to the measurement and/or structural portions of the model for latent x and y.}

\item{writeTo}{A character string specifying a directory path to where the
output file(s) should be saved. If set to \code{"."}, the file(s) will be written
to the current working directory. The default is \code{NULL}, and examples use a
temporary directory created by \code{tempdir()}. When dealing with tabular output,
\code{writeTo} is only relevant if \code{gtTab = TRUE}.}

\item{fileName}{A character string specifying a desired base name for the
output file. The default is \code{NULL}. The specified name will be automatically
appended with the appropriate file extension (e.g., \code{.txt} for \code{lavaan}
scripts, \code{.rtf} for tabular output when \code{gtTab = TRUE}, or other extensions
as appropriate for the output type). If a file with the same name already
exists in the user's chosen directory, it will be overwritten.}
}
\value{
character object of lavaan script that can be passed immediately to
lavaan functions. Users will receive message if structural comparisons are specified
when the recommended level of invariance is not also specified. If user supplies dvn
with containing X or Y variables, they are alerted to respecify the dvn object.
}
\description{
This function takes the outputted object from scrapeVarCross()
and automatically writes, returns, and exports (.txt) lavaan() syntax
for specifying Common Fate Models (CFMs). Users can
also invoke configural, loading, and/or intercept invariant
measurement models, and particular types of structural comparisons.
