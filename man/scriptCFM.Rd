\title{A Function That Writes, Saves, and Exports Syntax for
Fitting Latent Common Fate Models}
\usage{
scriptCFM(dvn, lvxname, lvyname, model = "configural")
}
\arguments{
\item{dvn}{input object from dyadVarNames()}

\item{lvxname}{input character to (arbitrarily) name LV X in lavaan syntax}

\item{lvyname}{input character to (arbitrarily) name LV Y in lavaan syntax}

\item{model}{input character used to specify which level of invariance is
modeled. Defaults to "configural"}
}
\value{
character object of lavaan script that can be passed immediately to
lavaan functions. Users will receive message if structural comparisons are specified
when the recommended level of invariance is not also specified. If user supplies dvn
with containing X or Y variables, they are alerted to respecify the dvn object.
}
\description{
This function takes the outputted object from dyadVarNames()
and automatically writes, returns, and exports (.txt) lavaan() syntax
for specifying Common Fate Models (CFMs). Users can
also invoke configural, loading, and/or intercept invariant
measurement models, and particular types of structural comparisons.

dvn = dyadVarNames(dat, xvar="X", yvar="Y", sep = ".",distinguish1 = "1", distinguish2 = "2")
cfm.script.config = scriptCFM(dvn, lvxname = "Conflict", lvyname = "Satisfaction", model = "configural")
